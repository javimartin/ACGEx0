What you have to do to run the raytracer:

 1. Open RayTracer.sln in Visual Studio 2008

 2. Compile

 3. Copy glut32.dll from src/bin to projects/vs2008/Release and projects/vs2008/Debug
 
 4. Change the working folder:
	- Right-click on RayTracer project (in Solution Explorer)
	- Go to: Properties->Debugging->Working Directories
	- Enter ../..

 5. Choose different scenes by setting Command Arguments:
	- Right-click on RayTracer project (in Solution Explorer)
	- Go to: Properties->Debugging->Command Arguments
	- Enter the path to the scene.xml. E.g. data/scenes/LGG/scene.xml

 6. Hint: /Debug, / Release and Raytracer.nbc are automatically generated by VS2008. You can delete them to save space, e.g. for handing in exercises

 7. Hint: For complex renderings, always run in Release mode, it is a lot faster.

 8. Hint: To make the rendering even faster, render it parallely by uncommentting lines 16, 17, 18 in Renderer.cpp. This feature should be used in Release mode. 
	  You can use Debug->"Start without debugging" or press Ctrl+F5 to get the best speed.
